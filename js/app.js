/* Pseudo Code
-The aim of the project is to create a memory game of flipping tiles to be paired against time. The game will have three different levels of difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and the option to compete against a friend.
-The game board will be a 6X6 grid and the tiles will have pictures of famous cartoon characters and associated sounds.
-The player will have to click on the difficulty level to start the game or click to play against another player.
-On start will have to click on  each tile/card to flip them and reveal a picture to pair it with another tile with the same picture on it.
-If the pair is successfull the tiles with the paired pictures will disappear until no tiles remain in the board.
-If the pair is unsuccesful the tiles will flip back to their original status.
-If single play is selected  the player will have a set time to finish the game, when the time is finished the play is halted.
-If the player goes against another player there won't be any time limit and the player that finishes first will win.
-BASIC GAME:
-create a 6 x 6 grid to display the game board.
-each cell of the grid corresponds to one of cards face down.
-create the cards to be used in the game
-shuffle the cards randomly into the game board
-the user should be able to click on only two different cards each play.
-the cards should flip on click.
-the cards with the same picture are 'paired' and should disappear from the board
-the cards that are not paired should flip back and available to be clicked again
-The game is finished when all cards are cleared from the board
COMPLICATIONS:
-add a timer to the game
-the player will have to clear the board in a set time
-the last ten seconds the timer will pulse red
-once the time has ran out the game will stop and a 'game over' message will appear on the screen
-add 'easy', 'medium', 'hard' levels of difficulty
-add the option of two player playing gainst each other
-add sounds to play when cards are paired
-display a winning message at the end of the game
-add a counter to keep track of best times, how many games won and how many games lost.
-finally style the page
