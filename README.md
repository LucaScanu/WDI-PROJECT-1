WDI-ldn-24 PROJECT1
My first project

As first project I have created a simple card memory game with a 3d flipping effect. I created an object oriented game using jQuery. To begin with I have created a 6x6 grid and uploaded 18 pictures into my images folder.
To shuffle the cards I have used the Durstenfeld shuffle algorithm (see screenshot below).
